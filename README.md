# NeuralNetwork_Coursework
Training codes on Euler for final project about Kaggle TGS Salt identification challenge. Using this code, I trained a model with Public LB - 0.84, ranking at top 10%.

The main training proccess folder contains the core training codes using my MyKerasPatch trainer. The rest folders 
are codes of cross validation data generation and majority vote realization.
